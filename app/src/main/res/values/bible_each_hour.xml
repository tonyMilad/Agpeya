            John (14:26 - 15:4)</item>
        <item>But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the
            Father will send in My name, He will
            teach you all things, and bring to your
            remembrance all things that I said to you.
            Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to
            you; not as the world gives do I give to
            you. Let not your heart be troubled,
            neither let it be afraid. You have heard Me
            say to you, ‘I am going away and coming
            back to you.’ If you loved Me, you would
            rejoice because I said, ‘I am going to the
            Father,’ for My Father is greater than I.
            “And now I have told you before it comes,
            that when it does come to pass, you may
            believe. I will no longer talk much with
            you, for the ruler of this world is coming,
            and he has nothing in Me. But that the
            world may know that I love the Father,
            and as the Father gave Me commandment,
            so I do. Arise, let us go from here.“I am
            the true vine, and My Father is the
            vinedresser. Every branch in Me that does
            not bear fruit He takes away; and every
            branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it
            may bear more fruit. You are already
            clean because of the word which I have
            spoken to you. Abide in Me, and I in you.

        <item>Lakini huyo Msaidizi, huyo Roho

            kuwakumbusha yote niliyowaambia.
            Amani nawaachieni; amani yangu
            nawapa; niwapavyo mimi sivyo kama
            ulimwengu utoavyo. Msifadhaike
            mioyoni mwenu, wala msiwe na woga.

            mngalinipenda, mngalifurahi kwa

            tawi lizaalo hulisafisha, ili lizidi kuzaa.
            Ninyi mmekwisha kuwa safi kwa sababu
            ya lile neno nililowaambia. Kaeni ndani

        <item>And seeing the multitudes, he went up on
            a mountain, and when He was seated His
            disciples came to Him. Then He opened
            His mouth and taught them, saying:
            “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs
            is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are
            those who mourn, for they shall be
            comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they
            shall inherit the earth. Blessed are those
            who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
            for they shall be filled. Blessed are the
            merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
            Blessed are the pure in heart, for they

            falsely for My sake. Rejoice and be
            exceedingly glad, for great is your reward
            in heaven, for so they persecuted the
            prophets who were before you. You are
            the salt of the earth; But if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then
            good for nothing but to be thrown out and
            trampled underfoot by men. “You are the

            hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a
            lamp and put it under a basket, but on a

            in the house. Let your light so shine

        <item>And the apostles, when they had returned,
            told Him all that they had done. Then He
            took them and went aside privately into a
            deserted place belonging to the city called
            Bethsaida. But when the multitudes knew
            it, they followed Him; and He received
            them and spoke to them about the
            kingdom of God, and healed those who
            had need of healing. When the day began
            to wear away, the twelve came and said to
            Him, “Send the multitude away, that they
            may go into the surrounding towns and
            country, and lodge and get provisions; for
            we are in a deserted place here.” But He
            said to them, “You give them something
            to eat.” And they said, “We have no more
            than five loaves and two fish, unless we go
            and buy food for all these people.” For
            there were about five thousand men. Then
            He said to His disciples, “Make them sit
            down in groups of fifty.” And they did so,
            and made them all sit down. Then He took
            the five loaves and the two fish, and
            looking up to heaven, He blessed and
            broke them, and gave them to the disciples
            to set before the multitude. So they all ate
            and were filled, and twelve baskets of the
            leftover fragments were taken up by them.

        <item>“Then the kingdom of heaven shall be
            likened to ten virgins who took their
            lamps and went out to meet the
            bridegroom. Now five of them were
            wise, and five were foolish. Those who were foolish took their lamps and took
            no oil with them, but the wise took oil in
            their vessels with their lamps. But while
            the bridegroom was delayed, they all
            slumbered and slept. “And at midnight a
            cry was heard: ‘Behold, the bridegroom
            is coming; go out to meet him!’ Then all
            those virgins arose and trimmed their
            lamps. And the foolish said to the wise,
            ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps
            are going out.’ But the wise answered,
            saying, ‘No, lest there should not be
            enough for us and you; but go rather to
            those who sell, and buy for yourselves.’
            And while they went to buy, the
            bridegroom came, and those who were
            ready went in with him to the wedding;
            and the door was shut. “Afterward the
            other virgins came also, saying, ‘Lord,
            Lord, open to us!’ But he answered and
            said, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, I do not

            (Luke 7:36 – 50)</item>
        <item>Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to
            eat with him. And He went to the
            Pharisee’s house, and sat down to eat.
            And behold, a woman in the city who
            was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus
            sat at the table in the Pharisee’s house,
            brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil,
            and stood at His feet behind Him
            weeping; and she began to wash His feet
            with her tears, and wiped them with the
            hair of her head; and she kissed His feet
            and anointed them with the fragrant oil.
            Now when the Pharisee who had invited
            Him saw this, he spoke to himself,
            saying, “This Man, if He were a prophet,
            would know who and what manner of
            woman this is who is touching Him, for
            she is a sinner.” and Jesus answered and
            said to him, “Simon, I have something to
            say to you.” So he said, “Teacher, say
            it.” “There was a certain creditor who
            had two debtors. One owed five hundred
            denarii, and the other fifty. And when
            they had nothing with which to repay, he
            freely forgave them both. Tell Me,
            therefore, which of them will love him
            more?” Simon answered and said, “I
            suppose the one whom he forgave more.”
            and He said to him, “You have rightly
            judged.” Then He turned to the woman
            and said to Simon, “Do you see this
            woman? I entered your house; you gave
            Me no water for My feet, but she has
            washed My feet with her tears and wiped
            them with the hair of her head. You gave
            Me no kiss, but this woman has not
            ceased to kiss My feet since the time I
            came in. You did not anoint My head
            with oil, but this woman has anointed My
            feet with fragrant oil. Therefore I say to
            you, her sins, which are many, are
            forgiven, for she loved much. But to
            whom little is forgiven, the same loves
            little.” then He said to her, “Your sins are
            forgiven.” and those who sat at the table
            with Him began to say to themselves,
            “Who is this who even forgives sins?”
            then He said to the woman, “Your faith
            has saved you. Go in peace.” GLORY BE

        <item>Mtu mmoja katika mafarisayo alimwalika
            ale chakula kwake; akaingia katika
            nyumba yake yule farisayo, akaketi
            chakulani. Na tazama, mwanamke mmoja
            wa mji ule, aliyekuwa mwenye dhambi,
            alipopata habari ya kuwa ameketi
            chakulani katika nyumba ya yule
            farisayo, alileta chupa ya marimari yenye
            marhamu. Akasimama nyuma karibu na
            miguu yake, akilia, akaanza
            kumdondoshea miguu machozi yake, na
            kuipangusa kwa nywele za kichwa chake,
            akiibusu-busu miguu yake na kuipaka
            yale marhamu. Basi, yule farisayo
            aliyemwalika alipoona vile, alisema
            moyoni mwake, Mtu huyu kama
            angekuwa nabii, angemtambua
            mwanamke huyu amgusaye, ni nani, naye
            ni wa namna gani, ya kwamba ni mwenye
            dhambi. Yesu akajibu akamwambia,
            Simoni, nina neno nitakalo kukuambia.
            Akasema, Mwalimu, nena. Akasema, Mtu
            mmoja mkopeshaji alikuwa na wadeni
            wawili; mmoja amwia dinari mia tano, na
            wa pili hamsini. Nao walipokuwa hawana
            cha kumlipa, aliwasamehe wote wawili.
            Katika hao wawili ni yupi atakayempenda
            zaidi? Simoni akajibu akasema, Nadhani
            ni yule ambaye alimsamehe nyingi.
            Akamwambia, Umeamua haki.
            Akamgeukia yule mwanamke,
            akamwambia Simoni, Wamwona
            mwanamke huyu? Niliingia nyumbani
            kwako, hukunipa maji kwa miguu yangu;
            bali huyu amenidondoshea machozi
            miguu yangu, na kuipangusa kwa nywele
            za kichwa chake. Wewe hukunibusu;
            lakini huyu tangu nilipoingia hakuacha
            kunibusu sana miguu yangu. Hukunipaka
            kichwa changu mafuta; bali huyu
            amenipaka miguu yangu marhamu. Kwa
            ajili ya hayo nakuambia, amesamehewa
            dhambi zake ambazo ni nyingi, kwa kuwa
            amependa sana; lakini asamehewaye
            kidogo, huyo hupenda kidogo. Kisha
            alimwambia mwanamke, umesamehewa
            dhambi zako. Ndipo wale walioketi
            chakulani pamoja naye walianza kusema
            mioyoni mwao, Ni nani huyu hata

            alms; provide yourselves money bags
            which do not grow old, a treasure in the
            heavens that does not fail, where no thief
            approaches nor moth destroys. For
            where your treasure is, there your heart
            will be also. “Let your waist be girded
            and your lamps burning; and you
            yourselves be like men who wait for
            their master, when he will return from

            that he will gird himself and have them
            sit down to eat, and will come and serve
            them. And if he should come in the
            second watch, or come in the third
            watch, and find them so, blessed are
            those servants. But know this, that if the
            master of the house had known what
            hour the thief would come, he would
            have watched and not allowed his house
            to be broken into. Therefore you also be
            ready, for the Son of Man is coming at
            an hour you do not expect.” then Peter
            said to Him, “Lord, do You speak this
            parable only to us, or to all people?”
            And the Lord said, “Who then is that
            faithful and wise steward, whom his
            master will make ruler over his
            household, to give them their portion of
            food in due season? Blessed is that
            servant whom his master will find so
            doing when he comes. Truly, I say to
            you that he will make him ruler over all
            that he has. But if that servant says in his
            heart, ‘My master is delaying his
            coming,’ and begins to beat the male and
            female servants, and to eat and drink and
            be drunk, the master of that servant will
            come on a day when he is not looking
            for him, and at an hour when he is not
            aware, and will cut him in two and
