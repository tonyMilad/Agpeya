        <item>Heri mtu yule asiyekwenda katika shauri
            la wasio haki; wala hakusimama katika
            njia ya wakosaji; wala hakuketi barazani
            pa wenye mizaha. Bali sheria ya BWANA
            ndiyo impendezayo, na sheria yake
            huitafakari mchana na usiku. Naye
            atakuwa kama mti uliopandwa
            kandokando ya vijito vya maji, uzaao
            matunda yake kwa majira yake, wala jani
            lake halinyauki; na kila alitendalo
            litafanikiwa. Sivyo walivyo wasio haki;
            hao ni kama makapi yapeperushwayo na
            upepo. Kwa hiyo wasio haki
            hawatasimama hukumuni, wala wakosaji
            katika kusanyiko la wenye haki. Kwa
            kuwa BWANA anaijua njia ya wenye
            haki, bali njia ya wasio haki itapotea.

        <item>Mbona mataifa wanafanya ghasia, na
            makabila wanatafakari ubatili? Wafalme
            wa dunia wanajipanga, na wakuu
            wanafanya shauri pamoja, juu ya
            BWANA, na juu ya masihi wake, na
            tuvipasue vifungo vyao, na kuzitupia
            mbali nasi kamba zao. Yeye aketiye
            mbinguni anacheka, Bwana anawafanyia
            dhihaka. Ndipo atakaposema nao kwa
            hasira yake, na kuwafadhaisha kwa
            ghadhabu yake. Nami nimemweka
            mfalme wangu juu ya Sayuni, mlima
            wangu mtakatifu. Nitaihubiri amri;
            BWANA aliniambia, ndiwe mwanangu,
            Mimi leo nimekuzaa. Uniombe, nami
            nitakupa mataifa kuwa urithi wako, na
            miisho ya dunia kuwa milki yako.
            Utawaponda kwa fimbo ya chuma, na
            kuwavunja kama chombo cha mfinyanzi.
            Na sasa, enyi wafalme, fanyeni akili, enyi
            waamuzi wa dunia, mwadibiwe.
            Mtumikieni BWANA kwa kicho,
            shangilieni kwa kutetemeka. Shikeni
            yaliyo bora, asije akafanya hasira nanyi
            mkapotea njiani, kwa kuwa hasira yake
            itawaka upesi; heri wote wanaomkimbilia.

            utukufu wangu na mwinua kichwa
            changu. Kwa sauti yangu namwita
            BWANA naye aniitikia toka mlima wake
            mtakatifu. Nalijilaza nikalala usingizi,
            nikaamka, kwa kuwa BWANA

            zote. BWANA, uinuke, Mungu wangu,
            uniokoe, maana umewapiga taya adui
            zangu wote; umewavunja meno wasio

        <item>Ee BWANA, uyasikilize maneno yangu,

            utaisikia sauti yangu, asubuhi
            nitakupangia dua yangu na kutazamia.
            Maana huwi Mungu apendezwaye na
            ubaya; mtu mwovu hatakaa kwako;
            wajivunao hawatasimama mbele za macho
            yako; unawachukia wote watendao ubatili.
            Utawaharibu wasemao uongo; BWANA
            humzira mwuaji na mwenye hila bali
            mimi, kwa wingi wa fadhili zako,
            nitaingia nyumbani mwako; na kusujudu

            yako, kwa sababu yao wanaoniotea.
            Uisawazishe njia yako mbele ya uso
            wangu, maana vinywani mwao hamna

            yao. Uwatoe nje kwa ajili ya wingi wa
            makosa yao, kwa maana wamekuasi
            Wewe. Nao wote wanaokukimbilia
            watafurahi; watapiga daima kelele za
            furaha. Kwa kuwa Wewe unawahifadhi,
            walipendao jina lako watakufurahia. Kwa

            Nimechoka kwa kuugua kwangu; kila
            usiku nakieleza kitanda changu;
            nalilowesha godoro langu kwa machozi

            Uwatazame adui zangu, maana ni wengi,
            wananichukia kwa machukio ya ukali.
            Unilinde nafsi yangu na kuniponya,
            nisiaibike, maana nakukimbilia Wewe.
            Ukamilifu na unyofu zinihifadhi, maana

            Israeli, katika taabu zake zote.

            planted by the rivers of water, that
            brings forth its fruit in its season, whose

            he does shall prosper. The ungodly are
            not so, but are like the chaff which the
            wind drives away. Therefore the ungodly
            shall not stand in the judgment, nor

            against His anointed, saying, “Let us
            break their bonds in pieces and cast
            away their cords from us.” He who sits
            in the heavens shall laugh; The Lord
            shall hold them in derision. Then He
            shall speak to them in His wrath, and
            distress them in His deep displeasure:
            “Yet I have set My King on My holy hill
            of Zion.” I will declare the decree the
            LORD has said to Me, ‘You are My
            Son, today I have begotten You. Ask of
            Me, and I will give You the nations for
            Your inheritance, and the ends of the

            break them with a rod of iron; You shall

            rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest
            He be angry, and you perish in the way,

            flattering lips and a double heart they
            speak. May the LORD cut off all
            flattering lips, and the tongue that speaks
            proud things, who have said, “With our
            tongue we will prevail; Our lips are our

            saints who are on the earth, “They are

            allow Your Holy One to see corruption.
            You will show me the path of life; In

        <item>The heavens declare the glory of God;
            And the firmament shows His
            handiwork. Day unto day utters speech,
            and night unto night reveals knowledge.
            There is no speech nor language where
            their voice is not heard. Their line has
            gone out through all the earth, and their
            words to the end of the world. In them
            He has set a tabernacle for the sun,
            which is like a bridegroom coming out
            of his chamber, and rejoices like a strong
            man to run its race. Its rising is from one
            end of heaven, and its circuit to the other
            end; And there is nothing hidden from
            its heat. The law of the LORD is perfect,
            converting the soul; The testimony of
            the LORD is sure, making wise the
            simple; The statutes of the LORD are
            right, rejoicing the heart; The
            commandment of the LORD is pure,
            enlightening the eyes; The fear of the
            LORD is clean, enduring forever; The
            judgments of the LORD are true and
            righteous altogether. More to be desired
            are they than gold, Yea, than much fine
            gold; Sweeter also than honey and the
            honeycomb. Moreover by them Your
            servant is warned, and in keeping them
            there is great reward. Who can
            understand his errors? Cleanse me from
            secret faults. Keep back Your servant
            also from pre- sumptuous sins; Let them
            not have dominion over me. Then I shall
            be blameless, and I shall be innocent of
            great transgression. Let the words of my

            Teach me Your paths. Lead me in Your
            truth and teach me, for You are the God
            of my salvation; On You I wait all the

            remember me, for Your goodness’ sake,
            O LORD. Good and upright is the
            LORD; Therefore He teaches sinners in
            the way. The humble He guides in
            justice, and the humble He teaches His
            way. All the paths of the LORD are
            mercy and truth, To such as keep His
            covenant and His testimonies. For Your
            name’s sake, O LORD, pardon my
            iniquity, for it is great. Who is the man
            that fears the LORD? Him shall He
            teach in the way He chooses. He himself
            shall dwell in prosperity, and his
            descendants shall inherit the earth. The
            secret of the LORD is with those who
            fear Him, and He will show them His
            covenant. My eyes are ever toward the
            LORD, for He shall pluck my feet out of
            the net. Turn Yourself to me, and have
            mercy on me, for I am desolate and
            afflicted. The troubles of my heart have
            enlarged; Bring me out of my distresses!
            Look on my affliction and my pain, and
            forgive all my sins. Consider my
            enemies, for they are many; And they
            hate me with cruel hatred. Keep my soul,
            and deliver me; Let me not be ashamed,
            for I put my trust in You. Let integrity
            and uprightness preserve me, for I wait
            for You. Redeem Israel, O God, out of

            One thing I have desired of the LORD,
            that will I seek: That I may dwell in the
            house of the LORD All the days of my

            and to inquire in His temple. For in the

            sing, yes, I will sing praises to the
            LORD. Hear, O LORD, when I cry with
            my voice! Have mercy also upon me,
            and answer me. When You said, “Seek
            My face,” my heart said to You, “Your
            face, LORD, I will seek.” Do not hide
            Your face from me; Do not turn Your
            servant away in anger; You have been
            my help; Do not leave me nor forsake
            me, O God of my salvation. When my
            father and my mother forsake me, then
            the LORD will take care of me. Teach
            me Your way, O LORD, and lead me in
            a smooth path, because of my enemies.
            Do not deliver me to the will of my
            adversaries; For false witnesses have
            risen against me, and such as breathe out
            violence. I would have lost heart, unless
            I had believed that I would see the
            goodness of the LORD In the land of the
            living. Wait on the LORD; Be of good

        <item>The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not
            want. He makes me to lie down in green
            pastures; He leads me beside the still
            waters. He restores my soul; He leads me
            in the paths of righteousness for His
            name’s sake. Yea, though I walk through
            the valley of the shadow of death, I will
            fear no evil; For You are with me; Your
            rod and Your staff, they comfort me. You
            prepare a table before me in the presence
            of my enemies; You anoint my head with
            oil; My cup runs over. Surely goodness
            and mercy shall follow me all the days of
            my life; And I will dwell in the house of
            the LORD forever. ALLELUIA.</item>

            who may ascend into the hill of the
            LORD? Or who may stand in His holy
            place? He who has clean hands and a pure

            idol, nor sworn deceitfully. He shall
            receive blessing from the LORD, and
            righteousness from the God of his
            salvation. This is Jacob, the generation of
            those who seek Him, who seek Your face.
            lift up your heads, O you gates! And be
            lifted up, you everlasting doors! And the
            King of glory shall come in. Who is this
            King of glory? The LORD strong and

        <item>I will extol You, O LORD, for You have
            lifted me up, and have not let my foes
            rejoice over me. O LORD my God, I cried
            out to You, and You healed me. O LORD,
            You brought my soul up from the grave;
            You have kept me alive, that I should not
            go down to the pit. Sing praise to the
            LORD, you saints of His, and give thanks
            at the remembrance of His holy name. For
            His anger is but for a moment, His favor is
            for life; Weeping may endure for a night,
            but joy comes in the morning. Now in my
            prosperity I said, “I shall never be
            moved.” LORD, by Your favor You have
            made my mountain stand strong; You hid
            Your face, and I was troubled. I cried out
            to You, O LORD; And to the LORD I
            made supplication: “What profit is there in
            my blood, When I go down to the pit?
            Will the dust praise You? Will it declare
            Your truth? Hear, O LORD, and have
            mercy on me; LORD, be my helper!” You
            have turned for me my mourning into
            dancing; You have put off my sackcloth
            and clothed me with gladness, to the end
            that my glory may sing praise to You and
            not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give

            My soul shall make its boast in the LORD;
            The humble shall hear of it and be glad.
            Oh, magnify the LORD with me, and let
            us exalt His name together. I sought the
            LORD, and He heard me, and delivered
            me from all my fears. They looked to Him
            and were radiant, and their faces were not
            ashamed. This poor man cried out, and the
            LORD heard him, and saved him out of all
            his troubles. The angel of the LORD
            encamps all around those who fear Him,
            and delivers them. Oh, taste and see that
            the LORD is good; Blessed is the man
            who trusts in Him! Oh, fear the LORD,
            you His saints! There is no want to those
            who fear Him. The young lions lack and
            suffer hunger; But those who seek the
            LORD shall not lack any good thing.
            Come, you children, listen to me; I will
            teach you the fear of the LORD. Who is
            the man who desires life, and loves many
            days, that he may see good? Keep your
            tongue from evil, and your lips from
            speaking deceit. Depart from evil and do
            good; Seek peace and pursue it. The eyes
            of the LORD are on the righteous, and His
            ears are open to their cry. The face of the
            LORD is against those who do evil, to cut
            off the remembrance of them from the
            earth. the righteous cry out, and the LORD
            hears, and delivers them out of all their
            troubles. The LORD is near to those who
            have a broken heart, and saves such as
            have a contrite spirit. Many are the
            affections of the righteous, but the LORD
            delivers him out of them all. He guards all
            his bones; Not one of them is broken. Evil
            shall slay the wicked, and those who hate
            the righteous shall be condemned. The
            LORD redeems the soul of His servants,
            and none of those who trust in Him shall
            be condemned. ALLELYUIA.

            The LORD will preserve him and keep

            him on his bed of illness; You will sustain
            him on his sickbed. I said, “LORD, be
            merciful to me; Heal my soul, for I have
            sinned against You.” My enemies speak
            evil of me: “When will he die, and his
            name perish?” And if he comes to see me,
            he speaks lies; His heart gathers iniquity to
            itself; When he goes out, he tells it. All
            who hate me whisper together against me;
            Against me they devise my hurt. “An evil
            disease,” they say, “clings to him. And
            now that he lies down, he will rise up no
            more.” Even my own familiar friend in
            whom I trusted, who ate my bread, Has
            lifted up his heel against me. But You, O
            LORD, be merciful to me, and raise me
            up, that I may repay them. By this I know
            that You are well pleased with me,
            because my enemy does not triumph over
            me. As for me, you uphold me in my

            by. I will cry out to God Most High, to
            God who performs all things for me. He
            shall send from heaven and save me; He
            reproaches the one who would swallow

            fire. Whose teeth are spears and arrows,
            And their tongue a sharp sword. Be
            exalted, O God, above the heavens; Let
            Your glory be above all the earth. They
            have prepared a net for my steps; My soul
            is bowed down; They have dug a pit
            before me; Into the midst of it they
            themselves have fallen. My heart is
            steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I
            will sing and give praise. Awake, my
            glory! Awake, lute and harp! I will
            awaken the dawn. I will praise You, O
            Lord, among the peoples; I will sing to
            You among the nations. For Your mercy
            reaches unto the heavens, and Your truth
            unto the clouds. Be exalted, O God, above
            the heavens; Let Your glory be above all

            You, when my heart is overwhelmed;
            Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
            For You have been a shelter for me, a
            strong tower from the enemy. I will abide
            in Your tabernacle for- ever; I will trust in
            the shelter of Your wings. For You, O
            God, have heard my vows; You have
            given me the heritage of those who fear
            Your name. You will prolong the king’s
            life, His years as many generations. He
            shall abide before God forever. Oh,

            Where there is no water. So I have looked
            for You in the sanctuary, to see Your
            power and Your glory. Because Your
            loving-kindness is better than life, my lips

            while I live; I will lift up my hands in
            Your name. My soul shall be satisfied as
            with marrow and fatness, and my mouth
            shall praise You with joyful lips. When I
            remember You on my bed, I meditate on
            You in the night watches. Because You
            have been my help, therefore in the

            hand upholds me. But those who seek my
            life, to destroy it, shall go into the lower
            parts of the earth. They shall fall by the

        <item>I will sing of mercy and justice; To You,

            wisely in a perfect way. Oh, when will
            You come to me? I will walk within my
            house with a perfect heart. I will set
            nothing wicked before my eyes; I hate the
            work of those who fall away; It shall not
            cling to me. A perverse heart shall depart
            from me; I will not know wickedness.
            Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor,
            him I will destroy; The one who has a
            haughty look and a proud heart, him I will
            not endure. My eyes shall be on the
            faithful of the land, that they may dwell

            giving them the heritage of the nations.
            The works of His hands are verity and

            good man deals graciously and lends; He
            will guide his affairs with discretion.
            Surely he will never be shaken; The
            righteous will be in everlasting

            yote ni amini, yamethibitika milele na
            milele, yamefanywa katika kweli na
            adili. Amewapelekea watu wake
            ukombozi, ameamuru agano lake liwe la
            milele, jina lake ni takatifu la kuogopwa.
            Kumcha BWANA ndio mwanzo wa
            hekima, wote wafanyao hayo wana akili
            njema, sifa zake zakaa milele.

        <item>Heri mtu yule amchaye BWANA,
            apendezwaye sana na maagizo yake.
            Wazao wake watakuwa hodari duniani;
            kizazi cha wenye adili kitabarikiwa.
            Nyumbani mwake mna utajiri na mali,
            na haki yake yakaa milele. Nuru
            huwazukia wenye adili gizani; ana
            fadhili na huruma na haki. Heri atendaye
            fadhili na kukopesha; atengenezaye
            mambo yake kwa haki. Kwa maana
            hataondoshwa kamwe; mwenye haki
            atakumbukwa milele. Hataogopa habari
            mbaya; moyo wake u imara ukimtumaini
            BWANA. Moyo wake umethibitika
            hataogopa, hata awaone watesi wake
            wameshindwa. Amekirimu, na kuwapa
            maskini, haki yake yakaa milele, pembe
            yake itatukuzwa kwa utukufu. Asiye
            haki ataona na kusikitika, atasaga meno
            yake na kuyeyuka, tamaa ya wasio haki
            itapotea. HALELUYA.</item>

        <item>Enyi watumishi wa BWANA, sifuni,
            lisifuni jina la BWANA. Jina la
            BWANA lihimidiwe tangu leo na hata
            milele. Toka maawio ya jua hata
            machweo yake jina la BWANA
            husifiwa. BWANA ni mkuu juu ya
            mataifa yote, na utukufu wake ni juu ya
            mbingu. Ni nani aliye mfano wa
            BWANA, Mungu wetu aketiye juu;
            anyenyekeaye kutazama, Mbinguni na
            duniani? Humwinua mnyonge kutoka
            mavumbini, na kumpandisha maskini
            kutoka jaani. Amketishe pamoja na
            wakuu, pamoja na wakuu wa watu wake.
            Huweka nyumbani mwanamke aliye
            tasa, awe mama ya watoto mwenye furaha. HALELUYA.</item>

        <item>Nampenda BWANA kwa kuwa
            anaisikiliza sauti yangu na dua zangu.
            Kwa maana amenitegea sikio lake, kwa
            hiyo nitamwita siku zangu zote. Kamba
            za mauti zilinizunguka, shida za kuzimu
            zilinipata. Naliona taabu na huzuni;
            nikaliitia jina la BWANA. Ee BWANA,
            nakuomba sana, Uniokoe nafsi yangu.
            BWANA ni mwenye neema na haki,
            naam, Mungu wetu ni mwenye rehema.
            BWANA huwalinda wasio na hila;
            nalidhilika, akaniokoa. Ee nafsi yangu,
            urudi rahani mwako, kwa kuwa
            BWANA amekutendea ukarimu. Maana
            umeniponya nafsi yangu na mauti,
            macho yangu na machozi, na miguu
            yangu na kuanguka. Nitaenenda mbele
            za BWANA katika nchi za walio hai.

        <item>Naliamini, kwa maana nitasema, mimi
            naliteswa sana. Mimi nalisema kwa
            haraka yangu, wanadamu wote ni

            ukarimu wake wote alionitendea?
            Nitakipokea kikombe cha wokovu; na
            kulitangaza jina la BWANA;
            nitaziondoa nadhiri zangu kwa
            BWANA, naam, mbele ya watu wake
